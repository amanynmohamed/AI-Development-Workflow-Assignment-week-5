# Week 5 – AI Development Workflow Assignment 🧠🏥

## 📌 Overview

This project applies the *AI Development Workflow* to a real-world healthcare use case: predicting patient readmission risk within 30 days of hospital discharge. The goal is to demonstrate a full pipeline—from problem definition to ethical analysis and deployment—using practical tools and AI best practices.

## 🏥 Case Study: Patient Readmission Prediction

### 🔹 Problem
Build a predictive model that identifies patients at high risk of being readmitted within 30 days after discharge, enabling hospitals to take proactive measures.

### 🔹 Objectives
- Reduce 30-day readmission rates.
- Improve patient outcomes through targeted interventions.
- Optimize hospital resource allocation.

### 🔹 Stakeholders
- Hospital Administration  
- Medical Staff (Doctors, Nurses)  
- Patients & Families  
- Case Managers / Coordinators

## 📊 Data Strategy

- *Sources*: Electronic Health Records (EHR), billing data, and Social Determinants of Health (SDOH).
- *Preprocessing Includes*:
  - Feature engineering (e.g., comorbidity index, medication adherence)
  - Missing value imputation
  - Scaling, encoding, and validation
- *Ethical Concerns*:
  - Patient privacy (HIPAA compliance)
  - Bias detection and fairness across demographics

---

## 🤖 Model Development

- *Chosen Model*: LightGBM – fast, accurate, and suitable for large structured medical datasets.
- *Evaluation Metrics*:
  - Precision: 60%
  - Recall: 80%
  - Confusion matrix based on hypothetical test set of 1000 patients
- *Overfitting Mitigation*: Early stopping on validation data

---

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

- Model deployed via REST API using FastAPI + Docker
- Integration with EHR system using FHIR standards
- Scalable infrastructure with monitoring (latency, performance, drift)
- Full HIPAA compliance (encryption, access control, audit logging)

---

## ⚖️ Ethics & Critical Thinking

- *Bias Mitigation*: Monitoring subgroup fairness, resampling, and explainable AI (XAI)
- *Interpretability vs Accuracy*: Balanced via model choice + SHAP explanations
- *Limited Resources Impact*: Preference for efficient models over deep learning in production

---

## 🔁 Workflow Reflection

- *Most challenging stage*: Data preprocessing due to quality, integration, and compliance issues
- *Future improvements*:
  - Advanced NLP on clinical notes
  - Real-time data integration
  - Full MLOps lifecycle (automated retraining)

## 📌 AI Workflow Diagram
The project follows a full-cycle pipeline:

*Problem Definition → Data Collection → Preprocessing → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment → Monitoring & Feedback Loop*
